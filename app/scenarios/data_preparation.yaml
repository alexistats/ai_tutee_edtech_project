description: Prepares the student to ready messy datasets for visualization through cleaning, reshaping, and aggregation.
subskills:
  - tidy_or_reshape_tables
  - cast_data_types_before_charting
  - handle_missing_values_consistently
  - aggregate_and_normalize_metrics
misconceptions:
  - plot_before_cleaning
  - aggregate_metrics_twice
  - ignore_outliers_affecting_scale
  - mix_units_without_standardizing
tasks:
  - Your dataset has separate monthly CSVs with slightly different column names. What steps would you take before visualizing trends?
  - A metric mixes dollars and percentages in the same column. How do you clarify and prepare it so charts stay interpretable?
  - Missing values appear in 15% of rows for a key column. What preparation questions should you ask before charting?
criteria:
  - Student outlines how to tidy or reshape source tables to match the analytic goal.
  - Student checks type casting, units, and missing values before plotting.
  - Student anticipates aggregation pitfalls and verifies calculations prior to visualization.
