subskills:
  - map_categorical_to_bar_or_column
  - map_temporal_to_line_or_area

tasks:
  - When you have monthly revenue totals, which chart families come to mind and what information do you need before committing?
  - Suppose you must show how respondents split across four plan types but one category dominates. How might you reason through chart options?
