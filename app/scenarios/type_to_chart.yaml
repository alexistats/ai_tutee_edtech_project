description: Builds intuition for pairing each data type with an effective chart family.
subskills:
  - map_categorical_to_bar_or_column
  - map_temporal_to_line_or_area
  - choose_distribution_charts_for_numeric
  - account_for_composition_constraints
misconceptions:
  - use_line_for_categories
  - default_to_pie_with_many_categories
  - ignore_aggregation_needs
tasks:
  - When you have monthly revenue totals, which chart families come to mind and what information do you need before committing?
  - Suppose you must show how respondents split across four plan types but one category dominates. How might you reason through chart options?
  - A colleague wants a line chart for customer segments labelled "Gold", "Silver", "Bronze". What probing question could you ask first?
criteria:
  - Student links each data type to likely chart families and articulates trade-offs.
  - Student considers composition limits and warns about overloaded categories.
  - Student challenges mismatched chart requests with clarifying questions.
