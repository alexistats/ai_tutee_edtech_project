name: chart_to_task
description: Guides the student to align a teacher's analytical intent with an appropriate visualization family.
subskills:
  - identify_task_intent
  - match_comparison_tasks_to_bars_or_columns
  - match_trend_tasks_to_lines_or_areas
  - select_distribution_views_for_spread
misconceptions:
  - confuse_rank_with_trend
  - assume_one_chart_fits_all_tasks
  - ignore_distribution_needs
tasks:
  - A teacher wants students to compare sales across five regions in one month. How would you confirm the analytic task before proposing visuals?
  - Someone suggests a pie chart to show whether customer satisfaction is improving. What questions help you test if that chart serves the task?
  - You are asked to reveal the spread of delivery times, but only an average is available. What follow-up would you pursue before recommending a chart?
criteria:
  - Student restates the analytic goal (comparison, trend, correlation, distribution, composition) before naming charts.
  - Student links chart choices to the expressed task and flags mismatches.
  - Student requests missing context needed to judge whether the chart will answer the question.
