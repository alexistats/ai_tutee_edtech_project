description: Guides the student to classify dataset fields by their measurement level before selecting visuals.
subskills:
  - distinguish_categorical_vs_numerical
  - differentiate_ordinal_vs_nominal
  - flag_identifier_fields
  - separate_discrete_vs_continuous
misconceptions:
  - treat_ids_as_numeric_values
  - assume_ordinal_behaves_like_continuous
  - ignore_temporal_formatting
tasks:
  - Your dataset has columns `customer_id`, `signup_date`, `plan_type`, and `monthly_usage`. How would you describe each column's data type before picking a chart?
  - A teammate encoded survey responses from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree" as numbers 1–5. What clarifying question would you ask before analyzing them?
  - You notice numeric department codes like 101, 102, 103. How can you confirm whether they're identifiers or continuous values for visualization?
criteria:
  - Student distinguishes between categorical, ordinal, and numeric fields with reasoning tied to the context.
  - Student flags identifiers or codes that should not drive quantitative encodings.
  - Student requests clarification whenever a column's data type is ambiguous.
